<p>The algorithm for allocating topics in this seminar will be decided after everybody has submitted a ranking. There are different possible algorithms:</p>
<h3>Cost Minimization Algorithms</h3>
<p>In a cost minimization algorithm, we assign a cost to every allocated student-topic pair and then choose an allocation that minimizes the sum of costs.</p>
<p>In one version, the cost is just the rank at which the student has ranked the allocated topic. Another cost function is the squared rank. Finally, one can choose a cost function that attempts to give each student one of her top-3 or top-5 topics. That may not always be feasible, however.</p>
<h3>Another Allocation</h3>
<p>Instead of minimizing a cost function, it is also possible to pick the following algorithm (officially called ‘Random Serial Dictatorship’):</p>
<p>The algorithm moves through all students in a purley random order: Each student gets her most preferred topic from the set of all topics that have not yet been given to a student earlier.</p>
