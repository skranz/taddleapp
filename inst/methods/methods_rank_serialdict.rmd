Topics in this seminar are allocated by the following algorithm:

1. Every student ranks all topics
2. The algorithm then moves through all students in a purley random order: Each student gets her most preferred topic from the set of all topics that have not yet been given to a student earlier.

With this algorithm it is always optimal for you to rank the topics according to your true preferences.
