<p>Topics in this seminar are allocated by the following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every student ranks all topics</li>
<li>The algorithm then moves through all students in a purely random order: Each student gets her most preferred topic from the set of all topics that have not yet been given to a student earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this algorithm it is always optimal for you to rank the topics according to your true preferences.</p>
