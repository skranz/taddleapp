    Choose allocation method after deadline
  descr: |
    Let students rank all topics until the deadline. After the deadline, you can compare the results for different allocation methods and pick one method.

    Truthful Revelation: Random Serial Dictatorship
  descr: |
    Random serial dictatorship is a simple mechanism that probably comes first to mind to most microeconomists. 
    
    1. Each Student ranks all topics
    2. The algorithm moves through all students in a purely random order. Each student gets her most preferred topic from the set of all topics that have not yet been given to a student earlier.

    Cost minimization mechanisms may appear most natural to the operations research community.
    
    1. Each Student ranks all topics    
    2. If a student $i$ is assigned a topic $t$, she ranks at position $p_{it}$, we assign to this match a cost of $c_{it}=p_{it}$. The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.

costmin_quad:
  title: Cost Minimization (quadratic)
  descr: |
    Cost minimization mechanisms may appear most natural to the operations research community.
    
    Compared to costs that are linear in the position, quadratic costs put a stronger penalty on assignments where some students get very low ranked topics. So more "equal" assignments are preferred. Otherwise the mechanism is the same:
    
    1. Each Student ranks all topics    
    
    2. If a student \(i\) is assigned a topic \(t\), she ranks at position \(p_{it}\), we assign to this match a cost of \(c_{it}=p_{it}^2\). The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.



costmin_cubic:
  title: Cost Minimization (cubic)
  descr: |
    Cost minimization mechanisms may appear most natural to the operations research community.
  
    With cubic costs one avoids even more allocations in which some students get a very low ranked topic than with quadratic costs. Otherwise the mechanism is the same:
    
    1. Each Student ranks all topics    
    
    2. If a student $i$ is assigned a topic $t$, she ranks at position $p_{it}$, we assign to this match a cost of $c_{it}=p_{it}^3$. The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.
