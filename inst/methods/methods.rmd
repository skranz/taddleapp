    Truthful Revelation: Random Serial Dictatorship
  descr: |
    Random serial dictatorship is a simple mechanism that probably comes first to mind to most microeconomists. 
    
    1. Each Student orders all topics from most preferred to least preferred.
    2. Then the algorithm moves through all students in a purely random order. Each student gets her most preferred topic from the set of all topics that have not yet been given to a student earlier.

    Cost minimization mechanisms may appear most natural to the operations research community.
    
    1. Each Student orders all topics from most preferred to least preferred.
    
    2. If a student $i$ is assigned a topic $t$, she ranks at position $p_{it}$, we assign to this match a cost of $c_{it}=p_{it}$. The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.

costmin_quad:
  title: Cost Minimization (quadratic)
  descr: |
    
    Compared to costs that are linear in the position, quadratic costs put a stronger penalty on assignments where some students get very low ranked topics. So more "equal" assignments are preferred.
    
    Otherwise the mechanism is the same:
    
    1. Students again submit their preferences over topics.
    
    2. If a student \(i\) is assigned a topic \(t\), she ranks at position \(p_{it}\), we assign to this match a cost of \(c_{it}=p_{it}^2\). The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.



costmin_cubic:
  title: Cost Minimization (cubic)
  descr: |
    With cubic costs one avoids even more allocations in which some students get a very low ranked topic than with quadratic costs. 
    
    Otherwise the mechanism is the same:
    
    1. Students again submit their preferences over topics.
    
    2. If a student $i$ is assigned a topic $t$, she ranks at position $p_{it}$, we assign to this match a cost of $c_{it}=p_{it}^3$. The algorithm finds that allocation that minimizes the sum of costs over all students.
